## Contut

Contut is marketplace where students can easily find home tutors. They can chat with tutors and send requests
to tutors. If the tutor accepts the request, the student can review the tutor.

Tutors have to upload official documentation and certificates proving their identities and academic credentials.
Our representatives then review the documentation and approve/deny the tutor accounts.

This is the final project that I wrote for my Software Engineering class in my University. It is hosted on
https://contut.herokuapp.com
